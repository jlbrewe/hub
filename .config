# These can be overridden by values in the shell.
# For example, to run the `router` with a locally running `manager`:
#   docker-compose run -e MANAGER_HOST=127.0.0.1:8000 router
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file

# A tag used to identify the environment used for example
# in exception reporting and filtering

# Used by `router` to reverse proxy `manager`
MANAGER_HOST=manager:8000

# In development do not force use of HTTPS
# and allow basic authentication for API
