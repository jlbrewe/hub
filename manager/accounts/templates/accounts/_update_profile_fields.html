Profile related fields of an account.

This is a seperate partial to `accounts/_update_profile_form.html`
so that these fields can also be used in `accounts/create.html`.

Currently excludes `image` file because file content is not compatible with JSON encoding
of forms. TODO: Fix, or provide a different form that does not use HTMX.
