"""
Module that defines the interface between the `director` (i.e Django) and the `broker` (i.e. RabbitMQ).

Defines three functions involved in a job's lifecycle:

- `dispatch_job` - send a job to a queue
- `update_job` - update the status of a job by checking it's (intermediate) result
- `check_job` - for a parent job, trigger any child jobs, and / or update it's status
- `cancel_job` - remove job from the queue, or terminate it if already started
